# Machine Learning Netflix Titles
The project is implemented using R language. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows.
The requirments for the project were:
 - To understand the dataset's structure using statistical summaries and data visualization;
 - Prepare the dataset for test and for validation;
 - Create machine learning models. I used 10-fold cross validation and Accuracy as metric. Also I applied the following algorithms: GLMNET, CART, kNN(k-Nearest Neighbour), Support Vector Machine and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Finnaly I compared and analyzed the results;            
 - Used the following ensemble methods in order to improve the results: Random Forest and Stochastic Gradient Boosting;
 - Finally I made a prediction based on ratings.
